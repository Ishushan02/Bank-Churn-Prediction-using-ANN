# Bank-Churn-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
Using the Artificial Neural Network I have predicted whether the bank employee will leave the service or not and achieved an Accuracy Score of 92%. I have also implemented the data handling process like, Under sampling, Over Sampling and Ensemble method to increase the precision and recall of the model and check there variation.
